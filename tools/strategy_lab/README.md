# Strategy Lab

Strategy Lab is a local, research-only pipeline for certified Backtester V2
strategies. It validates preregistered runs, inventories an external read-only
market-data pack, generates deterministic candidate datasets, certifies engine
parity, analyzes frozen development rules, and evaluates fixed-capacity ticker
allocation. It does not support Backtester V1, nominate a policy, or establish
strategy quality by itself.

The canonical S06 bracket run is `runspecs/s06_bracket_mvp.json`: 480 Grid V2
candidates, 30-minute data, two-month IS and one-month OOS, eight calendar
windows, and a frozen 24-development/94-holdout split. Six additional tracked
S06 v06-4-A2 run specs fix the entry family (reversal or trend) and trail family
(`r_trail`, `chandelier`, or `fixed_af_sar`). Dataset generation for those six
profiles is deliberately separate from preregistration.

`runspecs/s03_adaptive_ma_symmetric.json` declares 2,800 candidates (700 per MA)
for S03 Adaptive MA: KAMA, SuperSmoother, FRAMA, DSMA; lengths 25..250 by 25;
common Close Count 1..7 and T Band 0.2..2.0% by 0.2%. Only the four source axes
are independent. The plan stores explicit equal Long/Short values. This research
run fixes initial capital 1,000, commission 0.05%, position size 100%, contract
size 0.0001, both directions, and Emergency SL off. It uses the same inventory,
24/94 split, eight windows, frozen policy and 1,000-bar warmup as S06, with one
outer worker, one Numba thread and a 32 MB cache limit. These assumptions do not
change the separate external S03 baseline.

### Planning declarations

`generation.planning.enabled_tie_groups` is optional and must be an ordered
list of unique, declared group IDs. Missing and `[]` both disable ties; null,
scalars, malformed members, duplicates and unknown groups fail before execution
or output writes. `axis_values` keys must exactly equal `enabled_axes`, without
derived targets. All other required and unknown-field checks remain strict.

The required non-empty `enabled_variants` list remains an actual Grid selection
for public selectors. For internal selectors it declares the expected resolved
variant tuple: S03 fixes `base_params.useEmergencySL=false` and declares
`["plain"]`. Grid resolves the selector without a public variant request; Lab
requires exact declaration agreement before checking fingerprints and still
checks execution modes. Changing the selector changes plan identity.

Defaults are resolved without editing input dictionaries. Old specs retain
their normalized content and hashes; explicit empty ties remain present and may
hash differently from absence while sharing the no-tie Grid identity. Enabled
ties use Grid's existing identity; semantic/value keys describe expanded values.
Resume rejects changed plan/run identity even when fixed values coincide.
Candidate `start`/`end` defaults may be null; non-null window dates are rejected.
Window preparation remains the authority for segment boundaries.

Schema-v2 MTM is supported for generic signal reversal as well as position
execution, using the research-only optional sidecar and unchanged 26-column
compiled ABI. See [metric semantics](../../docs/METRICS.md#strategy-lab-mtm-drawdown).

## Safety and identity

- Source CSVs are read only. The tool never rewrites, sorts, or writes beside
  market data.
- Cross-host identities and run specifications are tracked under `runspecs/`.
- Resolved roots, host facts, generated datasets, caches, and temporary output
  live under ignored `output/`, `cache/`, or `tmp/`, or another explicit local
  path.
- An explicit `--data-root` wins over
  `MERLIN_STRATEGY_LAB_DATA_ROOT`; absence of both is an error.
- Absolute source roots and host metadata are provenance, not tracked identity.
- Output equal to or beneath the market-data root is rejected before writes or
  candidate execution.

The inventory builder rejects subdirectories, source symlinks, malformed file
names or schemas, duplicate canonical symbols, unexpected counts, and
insufficient initial-capital sizing headroom. Raw validation checks the accepted
file identity, exact header and column count, integer Unix-second timestamps,
strict ordering, duplicates, exact 30-minute cadence and boundaries, row count,
finite positive OHLC relationships, and finite non-negative volume.

## Commands

Run commands from the repository root. On Windows:

```powershell
$py = 'C:\Users\mt\Desktop\Strategy\S_Python\.venv\Scripts\python.exe'
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.config tools\strategy_lab\runspecs\s06_bracket_mvp.json
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.generate --help
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.certify --help
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.analysis.cli --help
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.analysis.allocation_certify --help
```

Linux/VPS environments use their configured project Python and native paths.
These modules bootstrap the repository `src/` path and require no manual
`PYTHONPATH` setup.

### Inventory

Rebuild the tracked inventory only as an explicitly reviewed preregistration
change:

```powershell
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.inventory `
  --data-root '<read-only-data-root>' `
  --output tools\strategy_lab\runspecs\tickers_current.json `
  --provenance-output tools\strategy_lab\output\current_pack_provenance.json `
  --expected-ticker-count 118 --development-ticker-count 24 `
  --timeframe-minutes 30 --initial-capital 1000 --risk-per-trade-pct 2 `
  --contract-size 0.0001 --max-stop-pct 8 --minimum-size-steps 100
```

### Generate a bounded dataset

```powershell
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.generate `
  tools\strategy_lab\runspecs\s06_bracket_mvp.json `
  --data-root '<read-only-data-root>' `
  --output-dir tools\strategy_lab\tmp\mtm-smoke `
  --ticker <canonical-symbol> --window 1
```

Repeat `--ticker` or `--window` for a larger subset. Use `--resume` only for an
identity-compatible partial output. Progress reports validation, group reuse or
regeneration, completion, output path, and duration—never performance results.

### Certify the real pack

For the bounded S03 gate, use a fresh external work directory and isolated
bytecode/compiler caches. The command validates all 118 sources, then executes
CRVUSDT windows 1, 2 and 3 with all 2,800 rows in both segments. It checks 39
deterministic geometry-selected candidates against reference execution in all
six segments, two fresh generation processes, partial/resume equivalence,
verified no-op, finite MTM, saved candidate geometry and partial analysis.

```powershell
$env:PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE = '1'
$env:NUMBA_CACHE_DIR = '<external-task-cache>'
& $py -B -m tools.strategy_lab.certify_s03_smoke `
  --data-root '<read-only-data-root>' --work-dir '<fresh-external-work-dir>'
```

The directory contains `selection.json` written before execution, `clean-a`,
`clean-b`, `resumed`, per-process logs, `analysis`, and `evidence.json`. To run
the underlying generation and partial read-back explicitly:

```powershell
& $py -B -m tools.strategy_lab.generate `
  tools\strategy_lab\runspecs\s03_adaptive_ma_symmetric.json `
  --data-root '<read-only-data-root>' --output-dir '<fresh-external-dataset>' `
  --ticker CRVUSDT --window 1 --window 2 --window 3
& $py -B -m tools.strategy_lab.analysis.cli analyze `
  --dataset '<fresh-external-dataset>' --scope development `
  --allow-partial-scope --output '<fresh-external-analysis>'
```

This is partial development evidence only. The run spec still declares all
eight windows; normal development requires windows 1..6. The explicit override
does not certify full development, holdout, allocation, or strategy quality.
The original S06 full-pack certifier and its frozen gates remain separate:

```powershell
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.certify `
  tools\strategy_lab\runspecs\s06_bracket_mvp.json `
  --data-root '<read-only-data-root>' `
  --work-dir tools\strategy_lab\tmp\real-pack-certification
```

This opt-in gate checks compiled/reference parity, selected typed-Slow parity,
one-thread/two-thread determinism, and deterministic smoke generation. The
separate isolated production HTTP WFA tie-back is intentionally outside normal
pytest discovery:

```powershell
$env:MERLIN_STRATEGY_LAB_DATA_ROOT = '<read-only-data-root>'
$env:MERLIN_STRATEGY_LAB_CERT_WORK_DIR = '<absolute-certification-dir>'
& $py tools/run_tests.py -- tests\strategy_lab\phase1b_real_wfa_certification.py
```

The explicit WFA command requires an existing real pack and the completed
`smoke_one` certification output; missing prerequisites fail. It remains outside
normal discovery. Ordinary normalization cases live in `test_strategy_lab_certify.py`
and share `certification_helpers.py` with the explicit WFA module. The ordinary
two-process smoke test reuses the configured external Numba cache, or a contained
temporary cache when unset. See [test isolation](../../tests/README.md), including
`MERLIN_TEST_ROOT` for nested checkouts.

### Analyze development data

```powershell
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.analysis.cli analyze `
  --dataset tools\strategy_lab\output\s06_bracket_mvp_mtm_v2 `
  --scope development `
  --output tools\strategy_lab\tmp\development-analysis
```

The deterministic analysis output contains exactly five files. The manifest
owns axes, actual windows, groups, and dataset identities; the normalized run
spec owns scopes, aggregation, trade gates, rule membership, tie-breaking,
evidence thresholds, outlier treatment, and bootstrap parameters. Rules see IS
data only until candidate IDs are frozen; OOS labels load afterward.

Supported readers dispatch by schema/version. A missing metric makes only its
dependent rules `unsupported_for_dataset`; a non-finite candidate observation
makes that candidate unavailable; finite zero remains data. Headline means
equal-weight valid tickers inside each UTC OOS block and then equal-weight
blocks. Descriptive month-block intervals are evidence, never pass/fail gates.

Run the explicit non-default real analysis certifier to compare bounded and
full-development point estimates with independent frozen oracles:

```powershell
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.analysis.certify `
  --dataset tools\strategy_lab\output\s06_bracket_mvp_mtm_v2
```

### Allocate fixed capacity

Dataset labels are mandatory and stable in comparison mode:

```powershell
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.analysis.cli allocate `
  --dataset canonical=tools\strategy_lab\output\s06_bracket_mvp_mtm_v2 `
  --scope development --rule primary_profit `
  --primary-k 6 --sensitivity-k 8 `
  --output tools\strategy_lab\tmp\development-allocation
```

Candidate choice freezes from current IS. Ticker scoring then ranks finite
current-IS net profit descending, finite selected IS trade count descending,
and canonical symbol ascending. In multi-dataset comparison, exact canonical
ticker and OOS UTC boundaries define aligned cells; every dataset ranks the
same common eligible pool before OOS is revealed.

Slot weight is always `1/K`. Underfill remains cash and is never renormalized.
Each K reports all-available, Bottom-K, Random-K, oracle, and anti-oracle
controls. Oracle controls are hindsight diagnostics. Compounding and tail
drawdown operate on calendar-block capacity returns, not bar-level portfolio
equity. Allocation publishes exactly six deterministic files, including
`ticker_allocations.csv`.

The opt-in allocation certifier checks bounded, underfilled, and full
development cases against an independent oracle. Repeat `--dataset label=path`
for an aligned comparison:

```powershell
& $py -m tools.strategy_lab.analysis.allocation_certify `
  --dataset canonical=tools\strategy_lab\output\s06_bracket_mvp_mtm_v2 `
  --rule primary_profit
```

## Dataset and resume contract

The generator builds one validated V2 plan and evaluates every candidate over
independent IS/OOS prepared segments. Effective `compiled_numba` execution is
required; unavailable compilation or silent reference fallback fails before a
group is published. Calendar windows come from Merlin's authoritative builder,
and every segment contains exactly 1,000 warmup bars before its evaluation
range.

Current `strategy_lab_dataset_v2` group arrays are `float64` with axes
`[candidate, segment, metric]`, segment order `[is, oos]`, and 21 declared
metrics. The final metric is research-only bar-close
`max_drawdown_mtm_pct`; it is not a public optimizer objective or persisted
Merlin run result. It differs from realized balance Max DD and TradingView's
intrabar High/Low drawdown. Signal-reversal execution is unsupported for this
metric and fails explicitly. See [metrics authority](../../docs/METRICS.md).

`candidates.json` preserves candidate order, identity, and geometry. Group
files publish atomically with checksums. `manifest.partial.json` claims only
published groups; resume revalidates schema, run, inventory, plan, axes, scope,
version, resources, digest, size, shape, and dtype. Missing or corrupt claimed
groups regenerate. `manifest.json` is the sole completion marker, and a fully
verified identical rerun returns `verified_noop`. A completed output is
immutable if later source, identity, or artifact verification fails.

The scope is `full` only for the exact accepted inventory and every declared
window; strict subsets are `smoke`. Resource settings are identity-bearing for
the frozen run. Changing worker, Numba-thread, or cache limits requires an
explicitly reviewed refreeze.

Analysis and allocation likewise reject output beneath an input dataset,
preserve incompatible existing output, and return `verified_noop` for a
byte-identical rerun. Development is the default scope. Holdout and temporal
scopes require both an explicit unlock and a frozen policy; allocation and
analysis must not infer permission from path names or available arrays.

## Interpretation boundary

The primary holdout is cross-sectional confirmation on new tickers over the
same months as development, not independent temporal confirmation. Later
windows are mandatory descriptive temporal checks. Random controls retain only
their deterministic summary, and oracle controls are non-deployable.

Canonical schema-v1 and schema-v2 datasets were generated and certified
locally. They are ignored, immutable evidence and may be absent in a fresh
clone. They are never silently regenerated or
treated as tracked fixtures. Historical prototypes or task records under
`docs/_work/`, when present locally, are non-authoritative development history
and are not imported by Strategy Lab.
