# Merlin

Merlin is a config-driven cryptocurrency strategy backtesting and
optimization platform with SQLite persistence and a Flask single-page web UI.

## Capabilities

- Single-strategy backtests with dynamic config-driven parameter forms.
- Backtester V1 optimization through Optuna or deterministic Fast Grid.
- Backtester V2 optimization through deterministic core-owned Grid V2,
  including full and budgeted sampled planning.
- Fixed and Adaptive walk-forward analysis with stitched OOS results.
- SQLite study history, multiple databases, manual/forward/OOS testing, and
  trade export.
- Start, Results, and Analytics pages, saved study sets, and a scheduled run
  Queue.
- Local V2 Strategy Lab workflows for certified dataset generation,
  certification, analysis, and fixed-capacity allocation.

## Optimizer compatibility

Backtester V1 supports Optuna and Grid. New Backtester V2 Optimize and WFA
requests must explicitly use Grid. Optuna has not been removed: historical V2
Optuna studies remain readable, supported replay/manual-test paths remain
compatible, and V1 Optuna remains fully supported. Merlin never silently
converts old Optuna requests, Queue items, Presets, or studies to Grid.

## Quick start

Install the pinned dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the web server:

```bash
cd src/ui
python server.py
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5001>.

On this Windows checkout, repository development and tests use:

```text
C:\Users\mt\Desktop\Strategy\S_Python\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

Linux/VPS hosts use their configured project environment.

The existing command-line backtest entry point has S01-specific defaults. Run
its help from `src/` rather than treating it as a generic V2 workflow:

```powershell
cd src
C:\Users\mt\Desktop\Strategy\S_Python\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_backtest.py --help
```

Its current default `--csv` path is repository-root-relative and does not
resolve from `src/`; for an actual run, pass an explicit path such as
`--csv ../data/raw/<file>`.

## UI workflow

- **Start** — select market data and a strategy, configure parameters,
  preview/run optimization or WFA, and manage queued runs. V1 exposes
  Optuna/Grid; V2 is Grid-only.
- **Results** — browse stored studies and trials/windows, run supported tests,
  view equity/parameter details, export trades, and manage database paths.
- **Analytics** — compare WFA studies and sets, filter research views, and
  inspect aggregated and focused equity results.

## Project layout

```text
src/       application, engines, strategies, storage, and Flask UI
data/      market inputs and tracked regression/certification baselines
tests/     core/server, V2, JavaScript, and Strategy Lab tests
tools/     maintenance, benchmark, and Strategy Lab commands
docs/      architecture, procedures, evidence, and documentation index
```

New strategy development should normally target Backtester V2. A V2 import
requires a strategy package, execution profile, signals/dataprep, Grid
planning compatibility, parity/certification evidence, and focused tests; it
is not only a `config.json` plus `strategy.py` change.

## Tests

Run from the repository root with the configured interpreter:

```bash
python tools/run_tests.py fast
python tools/run_tests.py full
```

If this checkout is nested inside another Git worktree, set `MERLIN_TEST_ROOT`
to an external location first. Use focused suites and prepared raw pytest as described in
[tests/README.md](tests/README.md).
